# GeometricTurtle

Welcome to GeometricTurtle! üê¢‚ú®

This repository contains Python scripts for drawing various shapes using the Turtle module. From simple 2D shapes like squares and circles to more complex 3D shapes like cubes and spheres, you'll find a range of examples to explore and experiment with.

## Shapes Included

- **2D Shapes:**
  - Square
  - Triangle
  - Pentagon
  - Hexagon
  - Octagon
  - Circle
  - Star
  - Heart
  - Arrow
  - Spiral
  - Flower
  - House
  - Sun

- **3D Shapes:**
  - Cube
  - Pyramid
  - Sphere (approximation using circles)

## Getting Started

To run the scripts and see the shapes drawn, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can execute each script individually by running `python <script_name>.py` in your terminal.

Feel free to modify the scripts, create your own shapes, or combine shapes to create more complex drawings. The possibilities are endless!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas for new shapes, improvements to existing shapes, or any other enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
